Executive Summary

Motivation

From my early childhood, I've held a deep passion for automobiles. Attending numerous car shows while growing up allowed me to witness the remarkable evolution of cars throughout the years. The transformations in safety features and the ability to achieve impressive speeds have consistently amazed me. This fascination is one of the reasons I find Formula 1 intriguing, as it showcases the incredible capabilities of these machines in reaching high speeds and maneuvering through corners with precision.
